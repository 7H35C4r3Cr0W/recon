# oscp-recon — progress log

Running record of what's been built, in order, so any session can pick up mid-stream.
**Read "Next up" first, then the newest log entry.** Authoritative specs live in `CLAUDE.md`
(the brief) and `ROADMAP.md` (the phase plan); this file is "where are we right now".

## Next up

**Phase 1, chunk 6** — `wordlist_picker` widget + notes pane (`<profile>/notes.md`) +
credentials dialog (writes `creds.json`). Chunk 6 finishes Phase 1; its exit check is
"scan an easy box → services in tree → click a service → HackTricks + Exploit-DB load,
tool hints populate" (chunks 4+5 already cover the click-to-load path).

## How to resume

1. `cd ~/oscp-recon` (repo is local-only, no git remote yet). `uv` lives at `~/.local/bin/uv`; run `uv sync` if deps are missing.
2. Gates before every commit: `uv run mypy --strict src/`, `uv run pytest -q`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run ruff format --check`. GUI tests need `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.
3. Commit each chunk once gates are green — no need to ask. Show any new *wrapped command* before writing it (CLAUDE.md §27); only recon tools on the §2 allowlist.
4. Update this file with each chunk and commit it alongside that chunk.

## Log (newest first)

### Phase 1 · chunk 5 — GUI references integration (this commit)
- `reference_pane.py`: real `QWebEngineView` loading the matched HackTricks page on service
  selection (graceful fallback to a link label when QtWebEngine can't init / is disabled);
  Exploit-DB list filled from `searchsploit --json` off the UI thread, click → loads the EDB
  page in the same view; emits `page_visited` → recorded via `Profile.add_reference_visited`.
- `SearchsploitWorker` (QThread) with stale-result guarding; workers kept alive until `finished`.

### Phase 1 · chunk 4 — three-pane GUI restructure (f0c9be7)
- MainWindow → `QSplitter(service_tree | tool_panel | reference_pane)`; selection wiring;
  `CommandWorker` runs ad-hoc tool-hint commands through the policy-enforced `shell.run`.

### Phase 1 · chunk 3 — creds.json + references-visited (76bae3d)
- `models.Credential`; `creds.py` (atomic 0600 write, `redact()`, dedup); `Profile` helpers
  `creds_path` / `credentials()` / `add_credential()` / `add_reference_visited()`.

### Phase 1 · chunk 2 — references subsystem (5a4dbd7)
- `references/` package: `services.yaml` + matcher (§14 precedence) + `searchsploit --json`
  Exploit-DB lookup (display-only). All tool-hint templates pass the exec policy.

### Phase 1 · chunk 1 — wordlists (155a7ac)
- `wordlists.py`: index wordlist paths, filter password lists (substring on any path part +
  metasploit + rockyou + symlink target), app-wide favorites.

### Phase 0 — scaffold (646fc29)
- Engine (`shell`/`models`/`config`/`profile`/`orchestrator`/`reporter`) + nmap module +
  Typer CLI + minimal PySide6 GUI + fixtures/tests. Hardened after adversarial review: target
  validation, exec allow/deny policy, atomic writes, real timeout watchdog, GUI safety.
