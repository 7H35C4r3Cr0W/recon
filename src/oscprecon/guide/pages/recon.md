# The recon workflow

## The three panes

| Pane | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Left — service tree** | Every discovered port/service. Non-standard HTTP/DB ports get their own node. |
| **Middle — tool panel** | The command builder for the selected service, a live shell preview, `Run` / `Dry-run`, and the streamed output. |
| **Right — reference pane** | The matched HackTricks page (vendored offline) and version-aware `searchsploit` Exploit-DB hits (lookup only). |

## Staged nmap discovery

Recon goes fast-to-thorough so you're never blocked waiting on a full scan:

1. **TCP top-1000** — quick first look.
2. **TCP full** (`-p-`) — every port.
3. **UDP top-100** — the common UDP services.
4. **Versioned** (`-sCV`) — service/version + default scripts on the ports that were found.

The **Run Recon** split-button chooses how heavy to go (Quick / Default / Full / Exam), and the
**Scan a host / range** dialog gives full nmap-flag control — scan type, `-Pn`, ports, timing, NSE,
free-form flags — with a live preview. The target can be a single IP **or a whole `/24`**.

## Per-service modules & the tier model

Each service has a module that runs the right enumeration, gated by a strict safety model:

- **Tier 1 — Auto.** Read-only checks with bounded output (null session, anonymous FTP, `showmount`,
  SNMP walk on default communities). Runs on one click.
- **Tier 2 — Shown, not auto.** A *single* attempt against a well-known account with an empty/default
  password (`administrator:''`, `sa:sa`). Pre-filled in **Manual follow-ups** — you click Run.
- **Tier 3 — Gated.** Iterating a list of credentials is **credential spraying** — off by default,
  behind opt-in Spray mode. See **Exploitation & spraying**.

## Conservative findings, visible failures

An open port, a version string, or an Exploit-DB match is **never** called a vulnerability — only
real weak postures (anonymous access, null session, SMB signing off) are flagged. And a
missing/blocked tool is called out with **`⚠ step did not run`**, so "no findings" is never confused
with "the service isn't there".

## Recon next steps

As findings land, the pattern library surfaces **Recon next steps** in the tool panel — sensible,
provenance-cited suggestions with a *Pre-fill command* button. They are hints; nothing auto-runs.
